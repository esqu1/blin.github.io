<p>Speedcubing is the art of solving Rubik's Cube-type puzzles as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I've been a member of the speedcubing community for nearly 10 years. Currently, I can solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube in
    about 10 seconds, with my personal best time being around 6.7 seconds.</p>
<p>My main speedcubing specialty is a puzzle known as the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-1_(puzzle)">Square-1</a>, a variant of the Rubik's Cube that can
    change its shape as it turns. In 2014, I was the US National Champion for the Square-1 event, wth an <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edGHWl2CV1s">average time of 12.83 seconds</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2016, I broke the world record for the Square-1 average time, bringing it to <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar6upSb9_hM">9.90 seconds</a>. Up until January 2017 I broke the same
    world record 3 more times, with average times (in seconds) of <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbWNAQVPb14">9.33</a>, <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KGQ4Iwm6O0">9.07</a>, and <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABNNLXlQX2s">8.45</a> (this record lasted until November 2017, where it
    was lowered to 8.38 seconds).
<p>For more of my speedcubing statistics and rankings, here is my <a
        href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2011LINB01">official WCA profile</a>.
<p>I've also organized 4 official WCA speedcubing competitions at Penn (the latest one is <a
        href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/PennCubeDaySpring2019">here</a>)
    in an effort to bring more competitions and competitors from the Philadelphia area.</p>
<p>Some other resources:
<ul>
    <li>I maintain a <a href="http://youtube.com/BrandonLin1">YouTube channel</a> on which I post, among a couple of
        solve videos, tutorial videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds2lC5bVui4">how to solve the
            Square-1</a> and many other advanced techniques videos for the Square-1.</li>
    <li>Occasionally I stream some speedcubing on my <a href="http://twitch.tv/b_lin_cubing">Twitch</a> as well.</li>
    <li>I also have a <a href="/cubing">cubing website</a> on this site. It contains some text tutorials and algorithms
        that I wrote up a while back.
