				<h1>How to Solve a Square-1</h1><hr>
				<p>So you came here wanting to learn how to solve a Square-1, eh? Awesome! Let's get you started.</p>
				<center><h2>The Square-1</h2></center>

				<p>The Square-1 is a rather unusual puzzle for those initially beginning to cube. Unlike a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, the Square-1 features abnormally shaped edges and corners, and by playing with the puzzle, we can see that the edges and corners can actually interchange positions.</p>
				<p>The ability of the Square-1 to change into positions that are not cubic-shaped is what drives many away from learning how to solve it. In reality, the Square-1 is not that difficult of a puzzle, as we will see later.</p>
				<p>If you are learning how to solve a Square-1, I presume you know how to solve a regular Rubik's Cube. If not, that's okay, but the tutorial might be a little harder to follow. Besides, you should learn how to solve the normal 3x3 cube before learning how to solve Square-1 anyway!</p>
				<center><h2>Video Tutorial</h2></center>
				<p>If you're more of a visual learner rather than reading text, I put together a video tutorial on how to solve a Square-1. The video covers exactly the same content as this text tutorial. </p>

				<p>However, if you would much prefer using this text tutorial, then read on!</p>
				<center><h2>Basic Foundations and Terminology</h2></center>
				<p>The way you want to hold a Square-1 is with the star-esque shapes on the top and bottom layers. The middle layer should be in a position such that the smaller rectangle is on the left rather than the right. If your middle layer has the smaller rectangle on the right; you are holding it wrong, flip the cube over so that it is on the left.</p>
				<p>Your color scheme may differ from mine (I hold black/white top and red front), but no matter what you should be holding the small rectangle on the left. If you are a lefty, then you may opt to have it on the right, and follow this tutorial by simply mirroring the algorithms.</p>
				<p>Now note there are only three ways you can turn the Square-1: the top face, the bottom face, and the "right" face, which can only be turned 180 degrees. For this reason, the notation we use in Square-1 solving is using a coordinate pair to represent how much to turn the top and bottom faces by and a forward slash (/) to represent an 180 degree turn of the so-called <b>slice</b>.</p>
