				<h1>How to Solve a Square-1</h1><hr>
				<p>So you came here wanting to learn how to solve a Square-1, eh? Awesome! Let's get you started.</p>
				<center><h2>The Square-1</h2></center>

				<p>The Square-1 is a rather unusual puzzle for those initially beginning to cube. Unlike a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, the Square-1 features abnormally shaped edges and corners, and by playing with the puzzle, we can see that the edges and corners can actually interchange positions.</p>
				<p>The ability of the Square-1 to change into positions that are not cubic-shaped is what drives many away from learning how to solve it. In reality, the Square-1 is not that difficult of a puzzle, as we will see later.</p>
				<p>If you are learning how to solve a Square-1, I presume you know how to solve a regular Rubik's Cube. If not, that's okay, but the tutorial might be a little harder to follow. Besides, you should learn how to solve the normal 3x3 cube before learning how to solve Square-1 anyway!</p>
				<center><h2>Video Tutorial</h2></center>
				<p>If you're more of a visual learner rather than reading text, I put together a video tutorial on how to solve a Square-1. The video covers exactly the same content as this text tutorial. </p>
