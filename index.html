<p>I'm an incoming software engineer at Facebook, a CS and mathematics enthusiast and an avid speedcuber.</p>
<p>I'm from New York City, where I attended Stuyvesant High School. Afterwards, I attended the University of
	Pennsylvania and graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a master's degree in data science.</p>
<p>Some of my other interests include speedcubing, music, and playing video and board games. </p>
